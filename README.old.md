### Maths tester

# Spec:
-   Create a litle maths tester in React
-   Should ask 5 GCSE maths questions
-   Each with 4 multiple choice options, 1 correct
-   If 5/5 --> final screen shows a celebratory graphic
-   Testers can go back and edit answers
-   Doesn't need to look pretty, but not dreadful
